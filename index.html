Since I was a little girl, architecture has been a defining facet of my liife; one that has filled me with inspiration and admiration. The integrity of the stories held within the walls of building speak to times past, times present, and even the times future. Architecture is an international encyclopedia, a shared vocabulary, not of style but of purpose and understanding. Churches house religion while universities and libraries facilitate the education of future generations. It is this history that i wish to be a part of. From the Coliseum to the skyscrapers of Chicago, I aspire to create monuments that withstand the test of time and define culture and lives.

I have been immersed in architecture for my entire life, as my parents are the owners of an interior design firm. More often than not, restaurant napkins would become velim on which we illustrated our visions. At home I had graph paper on which I would design houses to be critiqued. Many late summer nights were spent playing The Sims, caring a great deal more for the design of the houses than the game itself. These were the beginnings of what has become my passion for design, my urge to create.

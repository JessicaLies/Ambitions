      Since I was a little girl, architecture has been a defining   facet of my life; one that has filled me with inspiration and admiration. The integrity of the stories held within the walls of buildings speak to times past, times present, and even the times future. Architecture is a shared vocabulary, not of style, but of purpose and understanding. Churches house religion while universities and libraries facililtate the education of future generations. It is this history that I wish to be a part of. I aspire to create monuments that withstand the test of time and define culture. I wish to create the backdrop to life.

      I have been immersed in architecture for my entire life, as my parents are the owners of an interior design firm. More often than not, restaurant napkins would become velim on which we illustrated our visions. At home I had graph paper on which I would design houses to be critiqued. Many late summer nights were spent playing The Sims, caring a great deal more for the design of the houses than the game itself. These were the beginnings of what has become my passion for design, my urge to create.

      Now, nearly twenty years later, I am about to graduate from my final semester of architecture school where I will be awarded a bachelors of architecture. Throughout my carreer I have pushed myself to the limits in order to learn, experience, and advance my passion. I currently work three part time jobs, each relating to different disciplines of architecture, mechanical engineering, architecture, and interior design. Through these jobs I have built up a professional network as well as diverse education and skill set which has helped me through my education and will continue to help me as a further develop my professional reputation.

      With this back story, my ambitions for this class are related to helping me further prolipherate my  work and become public. After graduation, I hope to find a full time job where I will be immersed in a descursive and productive architecture firm in which I can further my education. This being said, to enter into a firm, it is very common, if not required, to send a copy of a professional portfolio of works so as to prove your skills and vision. I hope that throughout the semester I will learn enough about web design so as to design my own website which will serve as a online portfolio of my accomplishments and select works.
